The problems with Amazon's current design are many. It is too busy and could easily combine several of the sections it has divided out. There's also an unsightly amount of blank space on the right side. All in all, I find the main page unpleasant visually.

Changes:
~ added space between elements

~ streamlined the cards, navbar links/menus, and carouseled item sections

~ removed the carousel hero

~ made color coding of categories more consistent across the site

~ eliminated empty space on right side

~ changed ad and explore layout

~ attempted to improve responsiveness on desktop
